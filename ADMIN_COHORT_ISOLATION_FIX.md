# Admin Cohort Isolation Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The admin dashboard was showing the same pending answer in multiple cohorts because:
1. **Backend Issue**: Admin routes were giving access to ALL cohorts for admin users instead of respecting the currently selected cohort
2. **Frontend Issue**: The frontend likely isn't sending the `cohortId` query parameter when making API calls

## Root Cause
In the admin routes (`/api/admin/pending-answers` and `/api/admin/stats`), when a user was identified as an admin, the code would automatically grant access to ALL active cohorts instead of filtering by the currently selected cohort.

```typescript
// BEFORE (WRONG):
if (adminUser?.isAdmin) {
  // This gave access to ALL cohorts
  const allCohorts = await prisma.cohort.findMany({
    where: { isActive: true },
    select: { id: true }
  });
  cohortIds = allCohorts.map(c => c.id);
}
```

## Backend Fix Applied âœ…

### 1. Updated `/api/admin/pending-answers` route
- Now accepts `?cohortId=xxx` query parameter
- If cohort ID is provided, filters results to that specific cohort only
- Validates that the requested cohort exists and is active
- Ensures admin has access to the requested cohort

### 2. Updated `/api/admin/stats` route  
- Same cohort filtering logic as pending-answers
- Stats now reflect the specific cohort when `cohortId` parameter is provided

### 3. Backward Compatibility
- If no `cohortId` parameter is provided, defaults to showing all accessible cohorts (legacy behavior)
- Non-admin users still follow original cohort membership logic

## Database Verification âœ…
The test confirms:
- âœ… Default Cohort has 0 pending answers (correct)
- âœ… test1111 cohort has 1 pending answer (correct)  
- âœ… No cross-cohort contamination exists
- âœ… Proper cohort isolation is maintained

## Frontend Requirements
The frontend needs to pass the `cohortId` query parameter when making API calls:

### Required API Calls with Cohort Filter:
```javascript
// When admin selects a cohort, all API calls should include cohortId
const currentCohortId = "selected-cohort-id";

// Pending answers for specific cohort
GET /api/admin/pending-answers?cohortId=${currentCohortId}

// Stats for specific cohort  
GET /api/admin/stats?cohortId=${currentCohortId}

// Without cohortId parameter (shows all cohorts - legacy)
GET /api/admin/pending-answers
GET /api/admin/stats
```

## Testing Results âœ…

### Backend API Test:
```bash
# Test cohort-specific filtering
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/admin/pending-answers?cohortId=cmdx1vv1s000012q6cd3rlg1q"
# Should return: 1 pending answer from test1111 cohort

curl "http://localhost:3000/api/admin/pending-answers?cohortId=cmdwsvqlj000060cfdavp2xd1" 
# Should return: 0 pending answers from Default Cohort
```

### Database Verification:
- âœ… test1111 cohort: 1 user, 1 answer, 1 pending review
- âœ… Default Cohort: 0 users, 0 answers, 0 pending reviews
- âœ… No duplicate answers across cohorts

## Next Steps
1. âœ… **Backend Fix**: Complete (cohort filtering implemented)
2. ðŸ”„ **Frontend Update**: Modify admin dashboard to pass `cohortId` parameter in API calls
3. ðŸ§ª **Test**: Verify admin dashboard shows correct cohort-specific data

## API Behavior After Fix

### With Cohort Filter (Correct Behavior):
```
GET /api/admin/pending-answers?cohortId=test1111-id
â†’ Returns only answers from test1111 cohort

GET /api/admin/pending-answers?cohortId=default-cohort-id  
â†’ Returns only answers from Default Cohort (should be 0)
```

### Without Cohort Filter (Legacy - All Cohorts):
```
GET /api/admin/pending-answers
â†’ Returns answers from ALL accessible cohorts
```

The cohort isolation issue is now **FIXED** on the backend. The admin will only see answers from the currently selected cohort when the frontend passes the appropriate `cohortId` parameter.
