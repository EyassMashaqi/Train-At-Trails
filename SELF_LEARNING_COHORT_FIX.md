# Self Learning Cohort Filter Fix

## Problem
The Self Learning section in the Admin Dashboard was displaying all users instead of only showing users from the selected cohort, which was inconsistent with the Users tab behavior.

## Root Cause
The `MiniAnswersView` component was always calling `adminService.getAllUsers()` regardless of whether a specific cohort was selected, while the Users tab correctly filtered users based on the selected cohort.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated MiniAnswersView Component
- **File**: `frontend/src/components/MiniAnswersView.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added props interface `MiniAnswersViewProps` with `selectedCohortId` and `cohortUsers` parameters
  - Modified the component to accept and use these props
  - Updated `loadData` function to use provided `cohortUsers` when a cohort is selected
  - Used `useCallback` for proper dependency management
  - Updated User interface to use `id: number` to match AdminDashboard's User type
  - Updated `expandedUsers` Set to use `number` instead of `string`

### 2. Updated AdminDashboard
- **File**: `frontend/src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Modified the Self Learning tab to pass `selectedCohortId` and `cohortUsers` props to `MiniAnswersView`
  - When a cohort is selected, passes the filtered users from the Users tab
  - When no cohort is selected, passes `undefined` so `MiniAnswersView` loads all users

### 3. Logic Flow
```
Admin selects cohort → AdminDashboard loads cohort users → Passes users to MiniAnswersView
No cohort selected → AdminDashboard passes undefined → MiniAnswersView loads all users
```

## Behavior After Fix
- **With Cohort Selected**: Self Learning section shows only users from the selected cohort (same as Users tab)
- **Without Cohort Selected**: Self Learning section shows all users (same as Users tab)
- **Consistent Filtering**: Both Users and Self Learning tabs now use the same cohort filtering criteria

## Files Modified
1. `frontend/src/components/MiniAnswersView.tsx`
2. `frontend/src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx`

## Testing
1. Start the development servers
2. Login as admin
3. Go to Admin Dashboard
4. Select a cohort from the dropdown
5. Check Users tab - should show only cohort members
6. Check Self Learning tab - should now show only the same cohort members
7. Clear cohort selection
8. Both tabs should show all users

This fix ensures consistency between the Users and Self Learning sections when filtering by cohort.
