# Cohort Isolation Fix Summary

## Problem
The user reported that when a user answered a question from a specific cohort, the answer appeared in all cohorts in the system instead of being isolated to the specific cohort where the user answered it.

## Root Cause Analysis
After investigating the codebase, I identified several locations where cohort filtering was missing or incomplete:

1. **Submit Answer Route**: The existing answer check was missing cohort filtering
2. **Question Queries**: Various question lookups were not filtering by cohort
3. **Total Questions Count**: Progress calculations were not cohort-specific
4. **Next Question Route**: Question retrieval was not cohort-aware

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Submit Answer Route (`/game/answer`)
**File**: `backend/src/routes/game.ts`

**Issues Fixed**:
- Moved user cohort retrieval to the beginning of the route
- Added cohort filtering to existing answer checks
- Added cohort filtering to all question lookup queries (topicId, questionId, auto-detect)

**Changes**:
```typescript
// BEFORE: Missing cohort filter
const existingAnswer = await prisma.answer.findFirst({
  where: { 
    userId, 
    questionId: currentQuestion.id 
  }
});

// AFTER: With cohort filter
const existingAnswer = await prisma.answer.findFirst({
  where: { 
    userId, 
    questionId: currentQuestion.id,
    cohortId: userCohort?.cohortId
  }
});
```

### 2. Fixed Question Queries
**File**: `backend/src/routes/game.ts`

**Issues Fixed**:
- Added cohort filtering to question lookups by topicId
- Added cohort filtering to question lookups by questionId  
- Added cohort filtering to auto-detect current question
- Added cohort filtering to questions with modules query
- Added cohort filtering to total questions count

**Changes**:
```typescript
// BEFORE: Missing cohort filter
currentQuestion = await prisma.question.findFirst({
  where: { 
    id: topicId,
    isReleased: true
  }
});

// AFTER: With cohort filter
currentQuestion = await prisma.question.findFirst({
  where: { 
    id: topicId,
    isReleased: true,
    cohortId: userCohort?.cohortId
  }
});
```

### 3. Fixed Game Status Route
**File**: `backend/src/routes/game.ts`

**Issues Fixed**:
- Added cohort filtering to questionsWithModules query
- Added cohort filtering to totalQuestions count
- Ensured current question lookup includes cohort filter

### 4. Fixed Next Question Route
**File**: `backend/src/routes/game.ts`

**Issues Fixed**:
- Added user cohort retrieval to the route
- Added cohort filtering to latest question lookup

## Database Schema Verification
The database schema already had proper cohort isolation support:

1. **Answer Model**: Has `cohortId` field with proper foreign key
2. **Unique Constraint**: `@@unique([userId, questionId, cohortId])` ensures one answer per user per question per cohort
3. **Cascade Deletes**: Proper cleanup when cohorts are deleted

## Testing Results

### Before Fix
- Answers could potentially be visible across cohorts due to missing filters
- Question queries were not cohort-specific
- Progress calculations were global instead of cohort-specific

### After Fix
✅ **All tests pass**:
- No cross-cohort contamination found
- Admin view correctly isolated by cohort
- User view correctly limited to their enrolled cohort
- Answer submission properly restricted to user's cohort
- Question visibility properly filtered by cohort

## Verification Commands

To verify the fix is working:

```bash
# Test cohort isolation
cd backend
node test-cohort-isolation.js

# Test answer isolation specifically  
node test-answer-isolation.js
```

## Files Modified
1. `backend/src/routes/game.ts` - Main game routes with cohort filtering
2. `backend/test-cohort-isolation.js` - Test script (created)
3. `backend/test-answer-isolation.js` - Comprehensive test script (created)

## Impact
- ✅ Users can only see and answer questions from their enrolled cohort
- ✅ Answers are properly isolated per cohort
- ✅ Admin views are filtered by cohort access
- ✅ Progress tracking is cohort-specific
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility

## Security Benefits
- Prevents data leakage between cohorts
- Ensures proper multi-tenancy isolation
- Maintains user privacy and data segregation
- Supports proper role-based access control

The cohort isolation issue has been completely resolved with comprehensive filtering throughout the application.
